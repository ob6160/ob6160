### Welcome! âœ¨

> I care deeply about writing code that helps people, whether that be the end user or the developers I work with.

My career began with [Neontribe](https://neontribe.co.uk/), a digital agency based in Norwich, working on various projects centred around doing tech-for-good. 

Right now I'm part of a team at [the Guardian](https://github.com/guardian) whose mission is to develop, maintain, and advocate for best practice around the client side [tooling](https://github.com/guardian/libs) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/guardian/csnx) across the organisation. When I have time I also love to contribute to [Source](https://github.com/guardian/source) our open source design system. Before that I was part of the [Identity team](https://github.com/guardian/gateway) â€” building a better experience for users wanting to register for the the Guardian.  

Outside of work, I help to maintain the [Toilet Map](https://github.com/public-convenience-ltd/toiletmap), a project dedicated to helping people find a toilet whilst they're on the move and also put time into [various](https://github.com/ob6160/daynotes) [side](https://github.com/ob6160/caffeine) [projects](https://github.com/ob6160/html_parser_renderer).
